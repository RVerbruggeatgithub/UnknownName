-- To do list --

Features:
Add Escaped enemy counter and limit
Add Protective Dome/ Shield, if an enemy escapes, dome protection counter will be reduced by 1, if at 0, escaped enemy counter will increase.
    protective domes are restored next wave. Escaped enemy counter is not.
Add 4 background / Maps
Add main menu
Add toggle switch for auto/manual tower ?
Add fast forward option (tick speed?)
Add shop


Fixes needed:



Fixed:
near main.py:450 self.enemy_counter gets modified due to enemy spawned upon death of TrippetElite.
This shouldn't happen as it is being used as an index. This will also cause the round not terminate.
Update path upon moving a tower
Enemies with a high deviation in path end up getting lost near last few nodes. Maybe capture the deviation and add it to the boundery limit? (see wave 29 yolkee)
