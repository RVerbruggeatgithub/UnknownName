-- To do list --

Features:
Add Escaped enemy counter and limit

    protective domes are restored next wave. Escaped enemy counter is not.
Add 4 background / Maps
Add main menu
Add SHIELD_1: For each shield, protects from one incoming enemy

Fixes needed:
Selecting a tower too close to edge allows to tower to placed without blocking the path. removing the tower toggles the hex to blocked.
If enemy is too far off path it will not make it to the portal but keeps wandering.
