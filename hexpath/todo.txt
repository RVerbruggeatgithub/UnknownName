Fixes needed:



Fixed:
near main.py:450 self.enemy_counter gets modified due to enemy spawned upon death of TrippetElite.
This shouldn't happen as it is being used as an index. This will also cause the round not terminate.
Update path upon moving a tower
Enemies with a high deviation in path end up getting lost near last few nodes. Maybe capture the deviation and add it to the boundery limit? (see wave 29 yolkee)
